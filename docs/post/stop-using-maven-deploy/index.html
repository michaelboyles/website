<div class=content><p><a href=https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/><code>mvn deploy</code></a> is the final phase of
<a href=https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html>Maven&rsquo;s build lifecycle</a>. It&rsquo;s
responsible for uploading the artifacts produced by the previous phases of the build to an artifact repository like
<a href=https://www.sonatype.com/product-nexus-repository>Nexus</a> where they can be stored and accessed by other dependent
projects, or used as part of an automated deployment.</p>
<p>Maven is a build tool. Its responsibility should be to build the application. Tacking on an artifact upload step at the
end seems convenient and harmless enough, but in practice I&rsquo;ve found that I prefer to avoid using it.</p>
<p>The major problem as I see it is that there is that it&rsquo;s difficult to differentiate between a developer&rsquo;s machine and
the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_build_automation_software#Continuous_integration>build server</a>. There should
be no reason to upload artifacts from a development machine, and you should try your best to make doing so absolutely
impossible. If you don&rsquo;t then it becomes possible to circumvent any quality checks that are normally enforced by the
build server. It even allows you to push a build containing code that was never committed to source control. If you end
up in that situation, good luck decompiling your JARs to try to work out what changes were included.</p>
<p>One solution is to enforce authentication on your artifact repository, which of course you should be doing anyway. If
you have a username and password which only the build server knows, it would be impossible to upload artifacts from
anywhere else.</p>
<p>The problem I&rsquo;ve found with this is that Maven does not make it easy to keep the password secret. I&rsquo;ve often seen my
colleagues sharing passwords for artifact repos in plaintext or, worse, checking them into source control.</p>
<p>Maven does provide <a href=https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html>a way to encrypt passwords</a> but it
relies on keeping configuration files on the local filesystem, and keeping those files secret; you could try changing
the unix file permissions for those files but I find that unreliable. It can be a hassle to update the passwords if the
files exist on multiple runners. They could also be easily missed if you spin up a new build server and have nothing to
document that they&rsquo;re required.</p>
<p>The solution which has worked for me is to move the artifact upload step to a separate stage of the build pipeline,
after Maven has completed. I don&rsquo;t use any <code>&lt;distributionManagement></code>. I use Jenkins and the
<a href=https://plugins.jenkins.io/nexus-artifact-uploader/>Nexus Artifact Uploader plugin</a>. The only real downside is having
to manually enumerate the artifacts. In projects with a few modules it can get a bit tedious, but I&rsquo;ve sometimes
appreciated the fine-grained control of being able to exclude a module or two by simply omitting them from the list.</p>
<p>The section of my <a href=https://www.jenkins.io/pipeline/getting-started-pipelines/>build pipeline</a> responsible for
deployment will often look something like this:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-groovy data-lang=groovy>nexusArtifactUploader {
    nexusVersion(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;nexus3&#39;</span>)
    protocol(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;https&#39;</span>)
    nexusUrl(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;our-nexus-host&#39;</span>)
    groupId(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;com.mycorp&#39;</span>)
    version(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;1.2.3&#39;</span>)
    repository(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;my-repo-snapshots&#39;</span>)
    credentialsId(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;44620c50-1589-4617-a677-7563985e46e1&#39;</span>)
    artifact {
        artifactId(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;my-app&#39;</span>)
        type(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;jar&#39;</span>)
        file(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;target/my-app.jar&#39;</span>)
    }
    artifact {
        artifactId(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;my-app&#39;</span>)
        type(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;pom&#39;</span>)
        file(<span style=color:#a50>&#39;pom.xml&#39;</span>)
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The advantage here is that <code>credentialsId</code> is a <em>reference</em> to a set of credentials but the mechanism by which those
credentials are obtained is left up to the build server. I could store the password directly in Jenkins, or in a
separate secrets manager like <a href=https://www.vaultproject.io/>HashiCorp Vault</a> (which is what we do). Either way, the
credentials cannot be easily retrieved by a user, are easy to update, and their usage is fully documented in the
pipeline definition.</p>
<p>There are other advantages too. Splitting the artifact upload from the build means you&rsquo;ll get a more granular view of
where a pipeline has failed. If Maven and the upload are separate steps in the pipeline, then I can see quickly which
step has failed and I know immediately where to start looking. If Maven were responsible for both, both failures would
be conflated into a single step, and only the build output would reveal what went wrong.</p>
