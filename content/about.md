![Moi](/images/portrait-square.png)

I'm Michael Boyles. I'm a software developer working in the finance industry in London.

I'm mainly a Java developer but I'm doing increasingly more frontend (TypeScript & React) too. I've written C++ and
PHP professionally in the past and I'd rather not do that again.

I'm interested in source code and bytecode generation, object-oriented design, and statistics. I'll be writing about
that and other tech stuff.
