![Me](/images/portrait-square.png)

I'm Michael Boyles. I'm a software developer living and working in London. I'm working on starting my own company, a
SaaS for finance companies.

My current and preferred tech stack is Java+Spring and TypeScript+React. I've written C++ and PHP professionally in the
past and I'd rather not do that again.

I'm interested in code generation, object-oriented design, and statistics. I'll be writing about
that and other tech stuff.
