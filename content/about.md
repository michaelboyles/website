I'm Michael Boyles. I'm a software developer working in the finance industry in London.

I'm mainly a Java developer. Some JavaScript & React too. I've written C++ and PHP professionally in the past and I'd rather not do that again.

I'm interested in object-oriented design, source code and bytecode generation, stats. I'll be writing about that and other tech stuff.

This blog is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I wrote [the
theme](https://github.com/michaelboyles/weaving-theme) myself. [The source](https://github.com/michaelboyles/website) is on GitHub.
Feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/michaelboyles/website/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/michaelboyles/website/pulls)
for anything that's objectively wrong: spelling or grammar issues, code examples which don't compile, ~~my opinions~~.
