My [personal website](https://boyl.es), generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), hosted on GitHub pages.

The public version exists within `/docs` (GitHub Pages doesn't allow it to be called anything else).

Feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/michaelboyles/website/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/michaelboyles/website/pulls) for anything that's objectively wrong: spelling or grammar issues, code examples which don't compile, ~~my opinions~~.

To build and run it locally: 

 - [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). You need the extended version for SASS support. I use `0.85.0`.
 - In the root of this repo, run `hugo server`
 - Open http://localhost:1313/
